# Pirate Latitudes 0.1 in T81Lang - Ultimate Curses Enhanced Epic Adventure

## Overview

**Pirate Latitudes** is an epic adventure game set in the age of pirates, featuring ASCII-based storytelling, curses-enhanced UI, interactive gameplay, and a rich narrative experience. Now translated into **T81Lang** for **Base-81 computing** and **ternary execution**, **Pirate Latitudes 0.1** brings enhanced performance and type-aware gameplay mechanics, running on advanced **ternary logic** systems.

This game integrates interactive **ASCII movies**, an **extended UI**, **unit tests**, and features **save/load game functionality**. Using **T81Lang**, the game utilizes ternary computation for higher efficiency and a richer, more dynamic experience.

---

## Features

- **Epic Pirate Adventure**: Set sail in an immersive world full of pirates, treasures, and high seas adventures.
- **Ternary-Based Logic**: The game runs on **T81Lang** for **Base-81 computing**, leveraging ternary operations for improved efficiency and complex interactions.
- **Interactive ASCII Movies**: Watch ASCII-based movies and animations that tell the story and set the mood.
- **Extended UI**: Customizable UI using **curses** for terminal-based graphical interactions with real-time updates and intuitive input.
- **Unit Testing**: Automated unit tests written in **T81Lang** for verifying game mechanics and interactions.
- **Save/Load Game State**: Save your progress in **T81-encoded JSON format** and resume the adventure at any time.
- **Verbose Logging**: In-depth logging for debugging and development purposes, controlled by the `VERBOSE_GHIDRA` flag.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **T81Lang Environment**: Ensure your **T81Lang** environment is set up for ternary execution.
- **Curses Library**: For terminal-based UI (`pip install curses` or install via system package manager).
- **T81-based Development Tools**: Ensure you have **T81Lang** and associated tooling for compiling and running ternary code.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/copyl-sys/pirate_latitudes-0.1.t81.git
   cd pirate_latitudes-0.1.t81
   ```

2. Ensure your environment is prepared for **T81Lang** execution.

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python pirate_latitudes_0.1.py
   ```

---

## Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate through the game menus.
- **Enter**: Select options or make decisions in dialogue.
- **Quit**: Type `quit` in the input box to exit the game.
- **Save**: The game state is automatically saved to `pirate_latitudes_save.t81json`.

---

## T81 Integration

### T81 Data Types:
The game makes full use of **T81-based data types**, including:
- **Health**: Represented using **T81 integers** (`100t81`).
- **Skills**: All player skills are tracked in ternary form, e.g., **combat** skill as `5t81`.
- **Reputation**: The player's reputation is encoded using ternary logic (`0t81`).
- **Game State**: The **entire game state** is serialized using **T81-encoded JSON**, ensuring compatibility with ternary systems.

### Example of T81 Data Representation:
```t81lang
game_state := {
    "current_scene": "intro",
    "name": "Captain Anonymous",
    "inventory": [],
    "health": 100t81,  # T81 integer type for health
    "skills": {"combat": 5t81, "negotiation": 3t81, "puzzle": 4t81},
    "reputation": 0t81,
    "achievements": [],
    "story_log": []
}
```

## Roadmap

### Future Features:
- **Advanced Ternary Interactions**: Enhance AI-driven interactions and player decision-making using ternary logic.
- **Expanded Game World**: More scenes, challenges, and pirate lore, powered by **T81-based** state transitions.
- **Enhanced ASCII Movies**: More complex ASCII-based animations and movie sequences.
- **Optimized Save/Load Functionality**: Implement incremental save file updates for smoother game state management.

### Planned Updates:
- **Support for T729**: Further extend the game world with complex **T729 tensor operations** for advanced logic and simulation.
- **Real-Time Multiplayer Support**: Allow players to engage in cooperative or competitive pirate adventures with real-time data sync using **T81 networking** protocols.
